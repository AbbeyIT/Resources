Amazon Sumerian is a set of browser-based tools for creating high-quality virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and 3D applications easily without requiring any programming or 3D graphics expertise. With Sumerian, you can construct an interactive 3D scene without any programming experience, test it in the browser, and publish it as a website that is immediately available to users.

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. 

It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

Install Flask from [here](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) and get started.

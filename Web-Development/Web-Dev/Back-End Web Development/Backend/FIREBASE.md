Firebase is a collection of a set of services running on googles servers, that allow users to develop application without managing infrastucture for the APIs. It provides many services like Authentication, Database, Storage, ML-Kit and much more.  

## Starting With Firebase  
To create a new project, head over to their [official website](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project. After that you can add Firebase to any platform of your preference, be it [Android](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup), [iOS](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup) or [Web](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).

## Topics to Cover :books:

Firebase has great [Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs) that are easy to follow along. Below are the main topics that are useful for development via Firebase.

|S.No.|Topic|
|---|---|
|1.|Authentication|
|2.|Real-Time Database|
|3.|Cloud Firestore|
|4.|ML Kit|
|5.|Cloud Functions|

## Is that it? :disappointed_relieved:
If you want to develop a basic application, chances are that these topics are all you are gonna need, but Firebase has a lot more in store. 

The ML Kit mentioned above is quite vast. It allows you to inegrate useful ML tools in your application like Text Recognition, Barcode Scanning, Image Labeling, Face Recognition, Object Detection and much more. Recently with Android 10 Smart Replies have also been added. This too can be used via the ML Kit. Another use for Firebase is [Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) which can be used to intgrate notifications in your application and much more.

React Native is an open-source mobile app framework created by Facebook. It can be used to develop apps for Android, iOS and the Web. It allows users to write apps using the React library, giving it native platform capabilities.

## Companies that use React Native :computer:
AirBnb, Instagram, Discord, Myntra, Uber Eats, SoundCloud, and many more.

## Done? :disappointed_relieved:
If you have gone through the resources faithfully and completed some projects, give yourself a pat on the back. You can now call yourself a React Native developer.

If you want to explore the path of app development further, look into [Flutter](./FLUTTER.md), which is Google's app development toolkit.

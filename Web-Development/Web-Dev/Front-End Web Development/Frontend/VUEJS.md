Vue is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

## Who uses Vue? :raising_hand:
Nintendo, Louis Vuitton, Google Careers, Adobe, BMW, Namecheap and many more Tech Giants.

Once you get familiar these, you can very well call yourself a Vue Developer. It's recommended you practice this on a few projects to ensure you understand everything.

These are some of the projects to get to you started on your Vue journey.

## Done? :disappointed_relieved:
Not yet! Now that you've explored Vue, you can either learn [React](./REACT.md) & master frontend web dev or [Flutter](./FLUTTER.md) to start developing mobile apps. 

### Why Flutter?
Flutter and Vue have really similar State Management. A lot of other things also feel familiar so you won't really find it hard to learn Flutter.

We hope you now know the roadmap to being a professional Vue Developer :v:

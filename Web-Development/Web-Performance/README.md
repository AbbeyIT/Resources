Web performance refers to the speed in which web pages are downloaded and displayed on the user's web browser.Web performance also leads to less data travelling across the web, which in turn lowers a website's power consumption and environmental impact. Website performance nowadays has become the top priority, especially in the world full of online competition.

## How to Improve? :thinking:
|S.No.|Tips & Tricks|
|----|-----|
|1.|Optimize image size on your website, as though images improve the attractiveness of your website but they are usually large files that slow down a website. |
|2.|Reducing the number of plugins: Though they add more features to your website but the more plugins you install, the more resources are needed to run them. As a result, the website works slower and also security issues can appear.|
|3.|Using website caching: If a lot of users are accessing the page at one time, servers work slowly and need more time to deliver the web page to each user.Caching can help to manage this.|
|4.|Reduce the number of HTTP Request: When your browser fetches data from a server it does so using HTTP.The more HTTP requests your web page makes the slower it will load. |
|5.|Removing unnecessary characters from your HTML, JavaScript, and CSS that are not required to load, such as White space characters, New line characters, Comments, Block delimiters etc.This speeds up your load time as it reduces the amount of code that has to be requested from the server.|
|6.|Fix 404 errors: Depending upon the platform you are running, 404 errors can be quite taxing on your server.Fixing 404 errors allows smooth user experience.|
|7.|Reduce redirects: Website redirects create additional HTTP requests which negatively impact performance.Only keep redirects which are absolutely necesaary. |
|8.|Choosing a good and a fast web host to ensure better optimization.  |

Heroku is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps — we're the fastest way to go from idea to URL, bypassing all those infrastructure headaches.

## Why Heroku? :heart_eyes:
- Easy to use
- No Infrastructure Needed
- Useful DevCenter Documentation
- Heroku CLI
- Supports Several Databases and Data Stores
- Huge Toolbelt of Add-Ons
- Scale-Ready
- Autoconfiguration and “Convention Over Configuration” For Most Features
- Deploy from Different Sources
- Best for Learning and Quick Deployment

## Who uses Heroku? :raising_hand:
ConvertFlow, Ruckit, Kolide, RocketChart, Rhino, Pretzel and many more Tech Giants.

## Where do I learn from? :books:

Heroku [DevCenter Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/) is one of the best Documentations provided by any Cloud Computing platform. Just going through their Docs is enough to understand how Heroku works and use in Production. Once you're done with the basics, you can explore more add-ons and other features like the Heroku CLI, Config Vars, Buildpacks, etc.

## Error Handling using Logs :warning:
[Heroku Logs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging) is your goto place when you get any kind of errors!

## Done? :disappointed_relieved:
Not yet! Now that you've explored Heroku, you can either learn [Azure](./AZURE.md) or [GCP](./GCP.md) or [AWS](./AWS.md).

## Render Settings :gear:

Render settings determine the following characteristics:  
  - Output frame rate  
  - Duration  
  - Resolution  
  - Layer quality  

Output module settings—which are applied after render settings—determine post-rendering characteristics such as the following:  
  - Output format  
  - Compression options  
  - Cropping  
  - Whether to embed a link to the project in the output file  

**Steps for Rendering**  

1. Render and export a movie using the render queue.  
     - Choose Composition > Add To Render Queue.  
     - Drag the composition to the Render Queue panel.  

*AlTERNATIVE* : Render and export with Adobe Media Encoder.  

2. Choosing formats and output settings. Supported output formats  
     - Video for Windows (AVI; Windows only)  
     - QuickTime (MOV)  
           -- In the Render Queue panel, select QuickTime (MOV) encoding and compression settings.  
           -- In the QuickTime Options dialog box, choose a codec and set options according to the specific codec and your needs and Quality  

*Note*: A higher Quality setting produces better image quality but results in a bigger movie file.  


## *Result is a much bigger file than expected?* :thinking:
**HANDBRAKE IT!**  
[HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/): This open source video transcoder is a tool for converting video from nearly any format to a selection of modern, widely supported codecs.
NOTE: This will result in compressed size version of your video with just minor changes in quality.

# Internet of Things (IoT)

<p align="center"><img  height="200" src="https://i.ibb.co/5c8kbVz/Internet-of-Things.png"></p>

The Internet of Things is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.

# ROADMAP TO Learn IoT 

![IoT Image](https://www.cxotoday.com/ashojoac/2019/12/IoT-image-750x450.png)
## Introduction: 

The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a system of interrelated, internet-connected objects that are able to collect and transfer data over a wireless network without human intervention.

The personal or business possibilities are endless. A â€˜thingâ€™ can refer to a connected medical device, a biochip transponder (think livestock), a solar panel, a connected automobile with sensors that alert the driver to a myriad of possible issues (fuel, tire pressure, needed maintenance, and more) or any object, outfitted with sensors, that has the ability to gather and transfer data over a network.

### Initial Steps:
1. Learn [Arduino](Arduino.md)
2. Learn [RaspberryPi](RaspberryPi.md)

<hr>

## Concepts to Master
1. Operating Systems(Firmware)
2. PCB Design
3. Network Architecture(Cloud)
4. [C/C++](./README.md#19-c-language)
5. [Basics of Full Stack - to build user-friendly applications](../README.md#122-full-stack-web-development)
